# pset8_homepages
A set of html and css pages that make up a homepage along with associated html pages


So here we go to index.html where the map for my other html files
And also contains my demonstartion of my javascript skills
Where if you enter a name it will show you Hello your name and an exclamamtion mark.

Other files as youtube.html, blog.html, code.html, photography.html etc.
,just have same code containing hyperlinks to other websites in internet

And to provide all of these files some style I used styles.css linking id's and class from html files to it.

As it is said the html is the skeliton and the css is the skin and clothes( giving it personality) & javascript is the brain with logic.

And that's it for this README file, bye!!
